### QUESTION 1
 Describe the main differences between the CSS Flexbox layout model and the CSS Grid layout model. When 
 would you choose to use one over the other? 

# SOLUTION 1

# CSS Flexbox vs CSS Grid

## CSS Flexbox Layout

- **Flexbox** is a one-dimensional layout model used for arranging elements along a single axis (either horizontally or vertically).
- It's best suited for arranging items in a single row or column.
- It provides powerful alignment and distribution capabilities.
- Elements can be dynamically re-ordered and re-sized to adapt to different screen sizes.
- It's particularly useful for creating responsive designs within a single axis.

## CSS Grid Layout

- **CSS Grid** is a two-dimensional layout model used for creating grid-based layouts with rows and columns.
- It's best suited for creating complex, grid-based designs with both rows and columns.
- It provides precise control over the placement of elements in both the row and column axes.
- Elements can be placed in specific grid tracks or areas, allowing for precise control over the layout.
- It's well-suited for creating large-scale, grid-based page layouts.

## Choosing Between Flexbox and Grid

Use **Flexbox** when:

- You need to arrange elements in a single dimension (row or column).
- You want to align and distribute items within a container.
- You're creating components that need to be flexible and adapt to different screen sizes.

Use **Grid** when:

- You need to create a complex layout with both rows and columns.
- You require precise control over the placement of elements in both axes.
- You're designing a large-scale page layout with multiple sections.

**Note**: It's common to use both Flexbox and Grid together in a project. Flexbox can be used to fine-tune the alignment of items within grid cells.
